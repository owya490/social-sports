# Introducing **Custom Event Links** 🔗

We're excited to announce our latest feature that's going to make sharing your events easier than ever! Say hello to **Custom Event Links** - your new best friend for seamless event promotion.

## What are Custom Event Links?

Custom Event Links allow you to create a permanent, branded URL on SPORTSHUB that you can share anywhere - social media, emails, business cards, you name it! The best part? These links are **smart** - they automatically update to point to your latest event in your recurring event series.
