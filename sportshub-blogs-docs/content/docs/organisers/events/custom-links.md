## Overview

Custom links allow you to create memorable, branded URLs for your events that are much easier to share and remember than the default event ID links. Instead of sharing a long, complex URL, you can create something simple like `https://www.sportshub.net.au/event/<username>/weekly-tennis` that participants can easily type and remember.

Custom links are particularly valuable for:

- Regular events that you promote frequently
- Social media sharing and marketing
- Recurring events that automatically update to the latest occurrence

## Creating Custom Links

Navigate to the **Custom Links** section in your [Organiser Hub](https://www.sportshub.net.au/organiser/event/custom-links) under the Events menu to set up your custom links.

## Setting Up Your Custom Link

### Custom Link Name

Choose a descriptive name for internal reference - this helps you identify the purpose of each custom link in your dashboard.

### Custom Link URL

Create your custom URL following these simple rules:

- Must be between 3 and 30 characters long
- Use only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
- No spaces or special characters allowed
- Must be unique across the your custom links

**Good examples:** `weekly-tennis`, `friday-soccer`, `badminton-club`

**Avoid:** `Weekly Tennis` (spaces), `TENNIS` (uppercase), `tennis@club` (special characters)

### Link Type Selection

Choose between two link types:

| Link Type                     | Description                          | Best For                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Event Reference**           | Points to a specific single event    | One-off events, special tournaments, unique occasions |
| **Recurring Event Reference** | Points to a recurring event template | Regular weekly/monthly activities, ongoing classes    |

### Event Selection

After choosing your link type, select from:

- **Upcoming events** (for event references)
- **Active recurring templates** (for recurring event references)

## Benefits of Custom Links

### Automatic Updates

For recurring events, your custom link automatically redirects to the next upcoming event in the series. This means you can share the same link everywhere without constantly updating it.

### Professional Appearance

Your final URL will look like: `https://www.sportshub.net.au/event/username/custom-link`

This creates a clean, professional appearance that builds trust and is easy to share across all your marketing channels.

### Easy Sharing

Custom links are perfect for:

- Social media posts and bios where a consistent link prevents continuous updating
- A recognisable link that allows your audience to quickly identify which event is which
- A repeating social sport session where users can bookmark one link and access the new event weekly

Custom links transform complex event URLs into memorable, brandable web addresses that make promoting your events significantly easier.
