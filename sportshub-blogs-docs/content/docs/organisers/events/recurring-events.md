## Overview

Recurring events are perfect for "set and forget" activities that happen on a regular schedule. Whether you're running weekly training sessions, monthly tournaments, or fortnightly social games, this feature automatically creates events at your chosen intervals, saving you time and ensuring consistency for your participants.

This feature is ideal for:

- Regular training sessions or classes
- Weekly social games
- Any event that follows a predictable schedule

## Setting Up Recurring Events

Enable recurring events during event creation by accessing the **Additional Settings** section and configuring the recurrence parameters.

## Preview Your Recurring Schedule

During event creation, you'll see a table showing all future recurrence dates based on your settings. This preview helps you verify the schedule is correct before creating the events.

## How Recurring Events Work

- **First Event**: Created immediately upon submission and is available for booking right away
- **Future Events**: Created automatically according to your "Create Days Prior" setting
- **Consistent Details**: Each recurring event uses the same title, description, images, and settings as your original event

## Managing Recurring Events

After creation, you can view and manage your recurring event template through the [Organiser Hub](/docs/organisers/organiser-hub). This allows you to:

- Reference all events in the series
- Make changes to future events if needed
- Manage the overall recurring schedule

Recurring events provide a powerful way to maintain regular activities with minimal ongoing effort, ensuring your community always knows when and where to find your events.
