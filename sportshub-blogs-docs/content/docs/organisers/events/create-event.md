## Overview

This guide walks you through creating an event on SPORTSHUB. Whether you're organizing a casual pickup game or a competitive tournament, the event creation process is designed to be intuitive while giving you full control over all the details that matter to your participants.

Creating an event allows you to:

- Set up public events that appear on the main dashboard for anyone to join
- Create private events accessible only via direct link
- Configure payment options for paid events
- Add rich descriptions with images and detailed information
- Manage participant and event logistics

## Step-by-Step Event Creation

### 1. Navigate to Create Event

![create-event-button](/images/docs/organisers/events/create-event-button.png)
Click the **"Create Event"** button located in the top right corner of any page. This will take you to the event creation form where you can configure all aspects of your event.

### 2. Fill Out Basic Event Information

Complete the essential event details including:

- Event title and sport type
- Date, time, and duration
- Location and venue details
- Participant limits and pricing
- Privacy settings (public/private)

> [!TIP]
> To create paid events, you'll need to have Stripe connected to your account. You can choose to absorb Stripe processing fees yourself or pass them on to participants by adjusting the settings in the Additional Settings during event creation.

### 3. Upload Event Images

Add visual appeal to your event by uploading:

- **Thumbnail image**: A smaller image that appears in event listings and cards. This will need to be in a square aspect ratio.
- **Event banner image**: A larger hero image displayed on the event detail page. This will need to be in 16:9 aspect ratio.

High-quality images help attract more participants and give your event a professional appearance.

### 4. Write a Meaningful Description

Use the rich text editor to create a compelling event description that may include:

- What participants can expect
- Skill level requirements
- What to bring or wear
- Any special instructions or rules
- Contact information for questions

A well-written description helps set proper expectations and reduces participant questions.

## After Creating Your Event

Once your event is created, you will receive an email confirmation and can:

### Find Your Event

- **Public events**: Appear on the main dashboard where anyone can discover and join them
- **Private events**: Only accessible via the direct link you can share with intended participants

### Manage Your Event

Access comprehensive event management tools through the [Organiser Hub](/docs/organisers/organiser-hub), where you can:

- Monitor registrations and participant details
- Update event information
- Manage and manually add/ remove Participants
- Alter event settings and pause bookings.

Your newly created event will be immediately available for participants to join, and you'll receive notifications as people register.
