## Are You a Sports Organiser?

If you run sports events, classes, or activities - **you're an organiser**.

Whether it's coaching sessions, tournaments, fitness classes, or community meetups, you deserve better tools than spreadsheets, bank transfers and WhatsApp groups.

## The Problem You're Facing

Running sports events shouldn't be this hard:

❌ **Chasing payments** through bank transfers and cash  
❌ **Managing attendance** with endless phone calls and messages
