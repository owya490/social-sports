Recurring events allow you to automatically generate multiple instances of the same event at regular intervals. This is perfect for regular training sessions, weekly leagues, or monthly tournaments.

## Managing Recurrence

Recurrence settings:

1. **Enable Recurrence**: Toggle the "Enable Recurrence for this Event" switch
2. **Select Frequency**: Choose how often your event should repeat:

   - **Weekly**: Event repeats every week on the same day
   - **Fortnightly**: Event repeats every two weeks
   - **Monthly**: Event repeats every month on the same date

3. **Configure Settings**:
   - **Number of recurrences**: Set how many times the event should repeat (up to 99 times)
   - **Days prior for event creation**: Choose how many days before each occurrence the event should be automatically created

## Recurrence Preview

Once configured, you'll see a preview table showing:

- The sequence number of each occurrence
- The exact date for each recurring event instance

This preview helps you verify the schedule is correct before saving.

## Managing Individual Recurring Events

Each recurring event instance can be managed independently. All child recurrences can be viewed in the "Past Event" tab.

### Edit Event Details

- Update event title, description, and information for specific occurrences
- Modify event dates and times if needed
- Change venue location for particular instances
- Adjust participant limits and pricing per event

### Event Settings

- Configure registration settings for each occurrence
- Set up payment options and coupons
- Manage communication preferences
- Update cancellation policies

### Important Notes

- Changes to one recurring event instance don't automatically apply to others
- Each occurrence maintains its own participant list and registration data
- You can modify or cancel individual events without affecting the entire series

## Best Practices for Recurring Events

- **Plan Ahead**: Set appropriate lead times for event creation to give participants time to register
- **Consistent Scheduling**: Keep timing consistent across recurring events for participant convenience
- **Regular Monitoring**: Check each occurrence individually to ensure details remain accurate
- **Communication**: Use the series to establish routine but communicate any changes to specific instances clearly

## Modifying Recurrence Settings

To change recurrence settings for future events:

1. Access the Recurring event template settings from organiser hub, event navigation
2. Modify the recurrence configuration
3. Save changes - this will apply to future occurrences only
4. Existing created events will retain their individual settings
