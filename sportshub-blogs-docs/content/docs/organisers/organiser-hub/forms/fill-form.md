### During Checkout

When players register for your event, they'll encounter your custom form as part of their checkout session. The form appears seamlessly integrated into the registration flow, ensuring a smooth user experience.

### One Form Per Ticket

Each ticket purchase requires one complete form submission. This ensures you have comprehensive information for every player attending your event, making event management and communication more effective.

### Required Fields and Payment

All forms must be filled out (all required fields answered) before the player can progress to the payment step. This ensures data integrity and quality for your sporting events.
