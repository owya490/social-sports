Once you return to your SPORTSHUB _Organiser Hub Personal Settings_ tab, **please hit the Register for Stripe button again.** This helps our system update to ensure your account is synced between parties.

Finally, to verify integration success, check for:

- Your **Stripe Account ID** is now displayed
- The **"Register for Stripe"** card has disappeared

> [!WARNING]
> If your Stripe integration doesn't appear immediately, wait a few minutes, click the register button again/ refresh the page. The connection process can take a moment to sync between systems.

### 5. Test Paid Event Creation

Navigate to **Create Event** and verify that you can now:

- Set event pricing in the event details
- Access enabling paid events via event creation settings
- Create paid events successfully

Your Stripe integration is now complete! You can start creating paid events and collecting secure payments from your participants.
