Magic happens. This year’s Compass Digital Group anniversary celebration proved that some of the best innovations come from tight deadlines and ambitious ideas.\nThe Challenge: A 4-Hour Innovation Sprint Our annual celebration took an exciting turn this year with a hackathon format. The rules were simple: four hours, any technology, any idea. The goal? Create something that could genuinely impact our team’s workflow and productivity.\nWhile other teams explored various directions, Reggie and I found ourselves drawn to a problem we’d been discussing for months: how do we make coding more engaging and track our collective progress in a meaningful way?\nThe Eureka Moment: Gamifying GitHub The idea hit us like lightning: what if we could transform our daily coding activities into a role-playing game? What if every commit, pull request, and code review became a “quest” that awarded experience points?\nWe envisioned a system where:\nCommits became mini-quests worth XP Pull requests were major achievements Code reviews earned collaboration bonuses Monthly leaderboards created friendly competition The concept was ambitious for a four-hour window, but we were determined to make it work.\nBuilding the GitHub Stat Tracker The Technical Architecture Our solution centered around GitHub webhooks – the perfect bridge between our development activities and our gamification system. Here’s how we structured it:\nCore Components:\nWebhook Listener: Captures real-time GitHub events XP Calculator: Assigns points based on activity type and complexity Leaderboard Engine: Tracks monthly rankings and achievements Dashboard Interface: Displays stats, progress, and team standings Racing Against the Clock With only four hours, every decision mattered. We split responsibilities:\nReggie tackled further research, XP calculation and feature ideas I vibe coded the rest The time pressure actually helped us avoid over-engineering. We built exactly what we needed – no more, no less.\nThe Psychology of Gamification What surprised us most wasn’t just the productivity boost – it was how the system changed our team dynamics:\nPositive Competition: Instead of individual silos, we developed a culture of healthy competition mixed with collaboration.\nVisible Progress: Developers could finally see their daily contributions quantified and celebrated.\nRecognition System: Quiet contributors who might not speak up in meetings suddenly had their consistent efforts highlighted.\nMonthly Leaderboards: The Game Changer The monthly leaderboard became our secret weapon. Unlike daily or weekly cycles, the monthly format:\nSustained Motivation: Long enough to matter, short enough to feel achievable Comeback Opportunities: Bad weeks didn’t eliminate entire months Natural Reset: Fresh starts every month kept everyone engaged Technical Deep Dive: The Magic Behind the Scenes Webhook Integration // Simplified webhook handler app.post(\"/github-webhook\", (req, res) =\u003e { const event = req.headers[\"x-github-event\"]; const payload = req.body; switch (event) { case \"push\": awardCommitXP(payload); break; case \"pull_request\": awardPRXP(payload); break; case \"pull_request_review\": awardReviewXP(payload); break; } }); Lessons Learned: What We’d Do Differently The Good Simple deployment: Minimal infrastructure meant quick iteration Real-time feedback: Instant XP awards kept momentum high Team buy-in: Everyone embraced the system from day one The Improvements Anti-gaming measures: Some developers found ways to inflate XP, ahem Owen \u0026 Brian Quality metrics: We need to balance quantity with code quality Team achievements: Individual focus sometimes overshadowed collaboration Knowledge Sharing An unexpected benefit emerged: developers started sharing strategies for earning XP, which naturally led to:\nBest practice discussions Code review technique improvements Collaborative problem-solving approaches The Hackathon’s Lasting Legacy What started as a four-hour experiment has become an integral part of our development culture.

But what makes this feature truly special isn’t just what it does for users, but how we built it by fundamentally rethinking our payment architecture.","from-stateful-to-stateless-a-design-evolution#From Stateful to Stateless: A Design Evolution":"The Stateful Approach (v1) Initially, we built a stateful system where the backend tracked user progress:\n// Backend maintains state class FulfilmentSession { private int currentEntityIndex; private String currentUserId; private Map\u003cString, FulfilmentEntity\u003e entities; public FulfilmentEntity getCurrentEntity() { return entities.get(currentEntityIndex); } } Problems with this approach:\nComplex state management Race conditions between multiple browser tabs Inability to accurately manage state when users are redirected to external sites Difficult error recovery Server-side session tracking overhead The Stateless Approach (v2) We realized a much simpler approach: if a user has a link to a specific fulfilment entity, they’re on that step. The URL becomes the state.\n// URL structure defines the current state /fulfilment/{sessionId}/{entityId} // No server-side tracking needed! // The URL tells us exactly where the user is Benefits of stateless design:\nSimplicity: No complex state tracking Reliability: Users can bookmark, refresh, or share links Scalability: No server-side session storage Multi-device: Same URL works across devices Error Recovery: Users can always return to their exact position Implementation Details public class FulfilmentService { // Stateless entity info retrieval public GetFulfilmentEntityInfoResponse getFulfilmentEntityInfo( String fulfilmentSessionId, String fulfilmentEntityId ) { // No session tracking - just return entity details FulfilmentEntity entity = getEntityById(fulfilmentEntityId); return createResponse(entity); } } The frontend handles navigation between entities by constructing URLs:\n// Navigate to next entity const nextEntityId = await getNextFulfilmentEntity(sessionId, currentEntityId); router.push(`/fulfilment/${sessionId}/${nextEntityId}`); ","fulfilment-sessions-the-foundation#Fulfilment Sessions: The Foundation":"We realized we needed to abstract the concept of “completing a purchase” into a series of fulfilment entities that could be processed in sequence.\nThe beauty of this system lies in its modular design. Each fulfillment entity is completely independent and interchangeable, allowing us to easily swap components or add new functionality without touching existing code. Need to switch from Stripe to PayPal? Simply replace the STRIPE entity. Want to add a waiver signing step? Insert a WAIVER entity before payment. This plug-and-play approach gives us incredible flexibility to customize the user journey for different event types while maintaining a clean, maintainable codebase.\nThe Core Concept public enum FulfilmentEntityType { FORMS, // Collect custom information STRIPE, // Process payment END // Complete the transaction } Each fulfilment session contains an ordered list of entities that must be completed:\n// Example: Event with form → payment → completion List\u003cFulfilmentEntity\u003e entities = [ FormsFulfilmentEntity, // Collect attendee info StripeFulfilmentEntity, // Process payment EndFulfilmentEntity // Redirect to success page ] Multi-Ticket Forms For events requiring multiple tickets, we create one form entity per ticket:\n// 3 tickets = 3 form entities + 1 payment + 1 end List\u003cFulfilmentEntity\u003e entities = [ FormsFulfilmentEntity, // Ticket 1 info FormsFulfilmentEntity, // Ticket 2 info FormsFulfilmentEntity, // Ticket 3 info StripeFulfilmentEntity, // Single payment EndFulfilmentEntity // Success ] ","looking-forward#Looking Forward":"The architecture we built for Forms has become the foundation for other SPORTSHUB features. The fulfilment session pattern is now used for:\nEvent creation workflows User onboarding flows Payment processing Multi-step operations And the GlobalAppController pattern has simplified our entire backend architecture, making it easier to add new features while maintaining performance and reliability.\nThe SPORTSHUB Forms feature represents a perfect example of how good architecture decisions compound over time. By thinking deeply about the underlying patterns and building flexible, reusable systems, we created something that works beautifully for users while being a joy to work with as developers.\nWant to try SPORTSHUB Forms? Create an event and add a custom form to see the magic in action! 🚀","the-globalappcontroller-unifying-our-architecture#The GlobalAppController: Unifying Our Architecture":"As our fulfilment and forms functionality grew, we faced another challenge: endpoint proliferation. We had separate cloud functions for:\ninitFulfilmentSession getFulfilmentEntityInfo getNextFulfilmentEntity saveTempFormResponse updateFulfilmentEntity …and many more The Problem: Cold Starts and Complexity Each separate endpoint meant:\nMultiple cold starts: Each function had to warm up independently Resource inefficiency: Couldn’t share minimum instances across functions Deployment complexity: Managing dozens of individual functions Inconsistent error handling: Different patterns across functions The Solution: One Controller to Rule Them All We created the GlobalAppController – a unified endpoint that routes all requests internally:\n@HttpFunction public class GlobalAppController implements HttpFunction { public void service(HttpRequest request, HttpResponse response) { UnifiedRequest unifiedRequest = parseRequest(request); Object result = routeRequest(unifiedRequest); sendResponse(response, result); } private Object routeRequest(UnifiedRequest request) { EndpointType endpointType = request.endpointType(); Handler handler = HandlerRegistry.getHandler(endpointType); return handler.handle(handler.parse(request)); } } Type-Safe Routing The magic happens in our EndpointType enum and HandlerRegistry:\npublic enum EndpointType { SAVE_TEMP_FORM_RESPONSE(SaveTempFormResponseRequest.class, SaveTempFormResponseResponse.class), INIT_FULFILMENT_SESSION(InitCheckoutFulfilmentSessionRequest.class, InitCheckoutFulfilmentSessionResponse.class), GET_FULFILMENT_ENTITY_INFO(GetFulfilmentEntityInfoRequest.class, GetFulfilmentEntityInfoResponse.class), // ... all other endpoints } public class HandlerRegistry { private static final Map\u003cEndpointType, Handler\u003c?, ?\u003e\u003e handlers = new HashMap\u003c\u003e(); static { handlers.put(SAVE_TEMP_FORM_RESPONSE, new SaveTempFormResponseHandler()); handlers.put(INIT_FULFILMENT_SESSION, new InitFulfilmentSessionHandler()); handlers.put(GET_FULFILMENT_ENTITY_INFO, new GetFulfilmentEntityInfoHandler()); // ... register all handlers } } Frontend Integration The frontend sends all requests to a single endpoint via a central executeGlobalAppControllerFunction method, ensuring our code remains modular to easily add any new functionalities on the GlobalAppController.\nThe Benefits Performance Improvements:\nReduced cold starts: Single function stays warm longer Efficient resource utilization: One minimum instance handles all traffic Better connection pooling: Shared database connections Development Benefits:\nUnified error handling: Consistent patterns across all endpoints Easier testing: Mock one controller instead of many functions Simplified deployment: Single function to deploy and monitor Type safety: Compile-time checks for request/response types ","the-result-a-powerful-scalable-system#The Result: A Powerful, Scalable System":"The combination of stateless fulfilment sessions and the GlobalAppController created a system that is:\nFor Users: Seamless: Forms feel like a natural part of checkout Reliable: Can resume from any point without losing progress Flexible: Supports complex multi-step workflows For Developers: Maintainable: Clear separation of concerns Scalable: Stateless design handles any load Extensible: Easy to add new fulfilment entity types For Infrastructure: Efficient: Reduced cold starts and better resource utilization Simple: One endpoint to monitor and maintain Cost-effective: Optimized minimum instance allocation ","the-technical-challenge-generalizing-payment-workflows#The Technical Challenge: Generalizing Payment Workflows":"Initially, SPORTSHUB had a simple ticket purchasing flow:\nSelect tickets → Pay with Stripe → Done.\nBut forms introduced a new complexity: we needed a multi-step workflow that could handle different types of interactions before, during, and after payment.\nFrom Simple to Multi-Step // Before: Simple ticket purchase EventPayment → StripeCheckout → Success // After: Multi-step workflow with forms EventPayment → Form → Form → StripePayment → Success This required us to completely rethink our payment architecture and led to the creation of our Fulfilment Session system.","what-are-sportshub-forms#What Are SPORTSHUB Forms?":"SPORTSHUB Forms transform the ticket purchasing experience by allowing event organizers to get the necessary information they need from attendees – all in one smooth, integrated workflow.
