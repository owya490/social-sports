No more broken links or manual updates - your link stays fresh and always points to the current event in your series.\nWhy You’ll Love It 🎯 Brand Consistency: Keep your links clean and professional ⚡ Always Current: Links automatically update for recurring events 📱 Share Anywhere: Works on all platforms and devices 🔄 Zero Maintenance: Set it once, forget about it "},"title":"[Feature] Custom Event Links"},"/blogs/introducing-sportshub-blogs/":{"data":{"built-on-hugo-fast-flexible-and-fun#Built on HUGO: Fast, Flexible, and Fun":"","meet-hextra-our-theme-of-choice#Meet Hextra: Our Theme of Choice":"","welcome-to-the-brand-new-sportshub-blogs-#Welcome to the brand new \u003cstrong\u003eSPORTSHUB Blogs\u003c/strong\u003e! 🎉":"","whats-next#What\u0026rsquo;s Next?":"\nWelcome to the brand new SPORTSHUB Blogs! 🎉We’re super excited to launch this space where we’ll be sharing all the latest and greatest from the SPORTSHUB team.\nExpect a mix of feature release announcements, deep dives into our engineering adventures, and maybe even a few behind-the-scenes stories (with memes, if we’re feeling brave).\nWhy a Blog? We believe in building in the open and sharing what we learn. Whether it’s a shiny new feature, a tricky bug we squashed, or a cool hack that made our lives easier, we want you to be part of the journey. Plus, who doesn’t love a good blog post with some code snippets and GIFs?\nBuilt on HUGO: Fast, Flexible, and Fun Our blog is powered by HUGO, the industry standard and fastest static site generator out there. Seriously, it’s blazing fast—Hugo can build thousands of pages in seconds. Some fun facts:\n🚀 Speed Demon: Hugo is written in Go and can generate sites in milliseconds. 🏆 Industry Standard: Used by companies like DigitalOcean, Cloudflare, and many more. 🛠️ Markdown Magic: Write in Markdown, publish in style. Want to geek out more? Check out Hugo’s official site.\nWe opted with a this pre-built framework route as we want to keep our blog maintenance overhead to a minimum. Seeing we are only a team of 6 engineers, we want to prioritize our time developing features on SPORTSHUB, rather than building our blog site from scratch and having to cop maintenance overhead of a custom solution.\nThe Architecture: Simple, Robust, Scalable Here’s a peek under the hood:\nContent: All our posts (like this one!) are written in Markdown and live in our GitHub repo. Build: Hugo takes care of turning Markdown into beautiful, static HTML. Deploy: We push to GitHub, and our CI/CD pipeline takes care of the rest—no manual deploys, no fuss. Fast Delivery: Static sites mean lightning-fast load times and rock-solid reliability. Meet Hextra: Our Theme of Choice We wanted our blog to look as good as it reads, so we picked the Hextra theme for Hugo. It’s modern, clean, and super customizable. Plus, it comes with all the bells and whistles:\n🌈 Beautiful design out of the box 📱 Fully responsive (read us on your phone, tablet, or fridge) 🧩 Easy to extend and tweak What’s Next? Feature Announcements: Stay tuned for updates on new releases and improvements. Engineering Blogs: Deep dives, architecture decisions, and lessons learned. Community Spotlights: We love our users—maybe you’ll see your story here! Thanks for stopping by! If you have ideas, feedback, or just want to say hi, reach out to us or drop a comment below. Happy reading!\nBuilt with ❤️ by the SPORTSHUB team, powered by Hugo and Hextra.","why-a-blog#Why a Blog?":""},"title":"Introducing SPORTSHUB Blogs"}}
