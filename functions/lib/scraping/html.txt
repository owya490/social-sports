ASK IF ANY QUESTIONS**\n\nJoin us for an fun afternoon of ALL LEVELS (Beginners->Advanced) volleyball and outdoor fitness training at Sydney Park. This event is perfect for volleyball enthusiasts who want to improve their volleyball skills while enjoying the beautiful outdoors. Whether you are an experienced player or just starting out, this training session is designed to help you improve your technique, stamina, and overall fitness.\n\nDuring the session, we will warm up with training drills and exercises. You'll have the opportunity to enhance your volleyball skills and work on your agility and speed before playing games, in both a fun social, mixed-level setting and a more competitive setting with fellow volleyball lovers.\n\nDon't miss this chance to challenge yourself, meet new friends, and enjoy the thrill of playing volleyball in a stunning outdoor setting. Please make sure to bring your own water bottle and even volleyball if you have one.\n\nLet's come together, have an incredible workout, and take our volleyball and fitness skills to new heights!\n\n**CRUCIAL DETAILS**\n\n1. **RSVP is mandatory** to secure you spot.\nNo RSVP -> no spot for you. Read below for \"No spot\".\n2. **All skill levels are welcome.**\n3. Teams (based on skill level) will be **determined during the warm-up** exercises in the 1st hour. If you miss out on this, you will be allocated beginner level.\n4. During mixed play (when we have advanced and beginners on the same court) **hard serving and spiking is not allowed!**\n5. If you meetup name is not in English, this interferes with the organisation. I urge you to either a. write your name in English; b. add an English version to it; or c. when you RSVP, type your name in English. If you don't do this, you will be moved to the \"Not Going\" list.\n6. There is no permanent net/court set up at the park. We set it up at the start of each event, so don't expect to see the court when you arrive. Just be at the meeting spot ready to help set-up.\n7. If you are not **willing to help** set up and/or pack up the net, this group is not for you.\n\n**Level classification\\* (guide):**\n\n* **10:** Beginner still learning to serve, receive, pass, set & attack.\n* **15:** Achieve \\~50% of above skills.\n* **20:** Achieve >60% of above skills.\n* **25:** Achieve >80% of above skills and 3 touches.\n* **30:** Achieve >90% of above skills, 3 touches and is a true team player.\n\n**\\* Refer to your profile to see what your level is. If you haven't been given a rating yet, then we will consider you a Level 10 until we've had a chance to evaluate you. Please attend our Beginners welcome / ALL Levels session.**\n\n**Suggested Donation (CASH ONLY) to helps us with expenses:**\n\n* **Casual\\* visitor** **(1st timer or return player):** $2\n* **Member\\* (optional):** $20 for 6 months\n\\*Student rate at 50% of above. You must bring your student card for proof and we will take a photo for our records and future bookings)\n* **No Spot** (e.g. No RSVP or on Waitlist): $5, if allowed to play.\n* **Arriving late:** Let me know otherwise your spot may be given away.\n\n**Volleyball is a team sport** and as such, we need a team effort to carry the equipment from the carpark to the \"spot\" and then set-up. After the game, we need a team effort to pack up the equipment and to carry it back to the car. If you are not prepared to help, please do not join us. We only want team players, not selfish people.\n\n**Waitlists:** If your name is on the Waitlist, you do **NOT** have a spot. **A spot** **may become available to you up until midday** (even later) on the day of the event. Waitlists/allocated spots are now **discretionary** and not in order of response. This is to assist running the event as smoothly as possible for the organiser and the players & also to reward loyalty (members and regular players and those who turn up on time).\n\n**No-shows:** No shows are disrespectful towards the organiser and the other players (especially those on the waitlist) and will now be given 2 chances/warnings and banned on their 3rd \"no-show\". This includes yourself and any +1 guests you have reserved a spot for.\n\nTo avoid a no-show, make sure you **update your RSVP before 9am** of the morning of the meetup (i.e. Sunday morning 9am).\n\n**This also applies to those on the Waitlist**. If you are on the waitlist, there is a chance you will be moved to the \"Going\" list, so if you will no longer attend, ensure you change your RSVP to \"Not going\" by 9am (day of event).\n\n**Questions:** If you have any questions, please ask.\nNote that the organiser(s) may be busy in the hours leading up to the event, so if you have any questions, please ask them early enough.\nNote that if your question has been addressed in this description and you simply have not bothered to read it, you may not get a response. And of course you won't know that if you haven't read this, but then who's fault is that?\n\nIf this all makes sense and you agree, come join us for some good wholesome fun. See you at the park!\n\n**Location:**\nWe play in the large flat open area opposite the Kiosk/Cafe (with toilets) and children's playground.

Please make sure to bring your own water bottle and even volleyball if you have one.\n\nLet's come together, have an incredible workout, and take our volleyball and fitness skills to new heights!\n\n**CRUCIAL DETAILS**\n\n1. **RSVP is mandatory** to secure you spot.\nNo RSVP -\u003e no spot for you. Read below for \"No spot\".\n2. **All skill levels are welcome.**\n3. Teams (based on skill level) will be **determined during the warm-up** exercises in the 1st hour. If you miss out on this, you will be allocated beginner level.\n4. During mixed play (when we have advanced and beginners on the same court) **hard serving and spiking is not allowed!**\n5. If you meetup name is not in English, this interferes with the organisation. I urge you to either a. write your name in English; b. add an English version to it; or c. when you RSVP, type your name in English. If you don't do this, you will be moved to the \"Not Going\" list.\n6. There is no permanent net/court set up at the park. We set it up at the start of each event, so don't expect to see the court when you arrive. Just be at the meeting spot ready to help set-up.\n7. If you are not **willing to help** set up and/or pack up the net, this group is not for you.\n\n**Level classification\\* (guide):**\n\n* **10:** Beginner still learning to serve, receive, pass, set \u0026 attack.\n* **15:** Achieve \\~50% of above skills.\n* **20:** Achieve \u003e60% of above skills.\n* **25:** Achieve \u003e80% of above skills and 3 touches.\n* **30:** Achieve \u003e90% of above skills, 3 touches and is a true team player.\n\n**\\* Refer to your profile to see what your level is. If you haven't been given a rating yet, then we will consider you a Level 10 until we've had a chance to evaluate you. Please attend our Beginners welcome / ALL Levels session.**\n\n**Suggested Donation (CASH ONLY) to helps us with expenses:**\n\n* **Casual\\* visitor** **(1st timer or return player):** $2\n* **Member\\* (optional):** $20 for 6 months\n\\*Student rate at 50% of above. You must bring your student card for proof and we will take a photo for our records and future bookings)\n* **No Spot** (e.g. No RSVP or on Waitlist): $5, if allowed to play.\n* **Arriving late:** Let me know otherwise your spot may be given away.\n\n**Volleyball is a team sport** and as such, we need a team effort to carry the equipment from the carpark to the \"spot\" and then set-up. After the game, we need a team effort to pack up the equipment and to carry it back to the car. If you are not prepared to help, please do not join us. We only want team players, not selfish people.\n\n**Waitlists:** If your name is on the Waitlist, you do **NOT** have a spot. **A spot** **may become available to you up until midday** (even later) on the day of the event. Waitlists/allocated spots are now **discretionary** and not in order of response. This is to assist running the event as smoothly as possible for the organiser and the players \u0026 also to reward loyalty (members and regular players and those who turn up on time).\n\n**No-shows:** No shows are disrespectful towards the organiser and the other players (especially those on the waitlist) and will now be given 2 chances/warnings and banned on their 3rd \"no-show\". This includes yourself and any +1 guests you have reserved a spot for.\n\nTo avoid a no-show, make sure you **update your RSVP before 9am** of the morning of the meetup (i.e. Sunday morning 9am).\n\n**This also applies to those on the Waitlist**. If you are on the waitlist, there is a chance you will be moved to the \"Going\" list, so if you will no longer attend, ensure you change your RSVP to \"Not going\" by 9am (day of event).\n\n**Questions:** If you have any questions, please ask.\nNote that the organiser(s) may be busy in the hours leading up to the event, so if you have any questions, please ask them early enough.\nNote that if your question has been addressed in this description and you simply have not bothered to read it, you may not get a response. And of course you won't know that if you haven't read this, but then who's fault is that?\n\nIf this all makes sense and you agree, come join us for some good wholesome fun. See you at the park!\n\n**Location:**\nWe play in the large flat open area opposite the Kiosk/Cafe (with toilets) and children's playground. These maps should help:\n\n* [Photo/map](https://www.meetup.com/volleyball-at-sydney-park/photos/33390251/512713637/)\n* [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8KHnSEGbQXHrHKnBA)\n\nBy attending any of our events, you and your guests agree to our [Terms \u0026 Conditions](https://www.meetup.com/volleyball-at-sydney-park/photos/34863764/523484638/).","eventType":"PHYSICAL","eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/volleyball-at-sydney-park/events/310207624/","featuredEventPhoto":{"__ref":"PhotoInfo:518374616"},"feeSettings":{"__typename":"EventFeeSettings","accepts":"CASH","currency":"AUD","amount":2},"isOnline":false,"isSaved":false,"covidPrecautions":{"__typename":"CovidPrecautions","venueType":null},"maxTickets":18,"rsvpState":"JOIN_OPEN","title":"Volleyball.

We can help you achieve this goal by working as a team. You will be being guided by professional musicians with years of live music experience, touring and teaching.\n\nThis is also this is a great environment to meet fellow musicians and talk all things music.\n\nMoving on from what the more casual format of Sydney Jammers, we want to focus a smaller song list but with an end goal of having a tighter sounding unit. From there we would be booking a showcase style gigs at least twice a year.\n\nHere is a link to our current playlist of songs: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4V8j6vHUQugXlvZvnoFxCV?si=0105ebfb356f4889\n\nThis will be a smaller style jam where spots and numbers will be limited. So pre-booking and pre payment is essential. The song lists will also be curated with charts provided. This will be done in advance of each jam so that you have time to learn the songs.\n\nWith regards to equipment, we provide a drum kit, P.A system, mics and a bass amp. We do have a few small guitar amps available, however we recommend you bring your own practice amp.\nWe look forward to having you in our studio.\n\nPlease note, number a limited to 12.
